      <h2>Dark Matter and Dark Energy: Unraveling the Cosmic Mysteries</h2>
      
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Dark matter and dark energy are two of the most enigmatic components of the universe. While they cannot be directly observed, their effects shape the cosmos on the largest scales. Together, they make up about 95% of the universe's total mass-energy content, yet their true nature remains a profound mystery.</p>
      
      <h3>Dark Matter: The Invisible Mass</h3>
      <p>Dark matter is a mysterious substance that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to conventional telescopes. However, its presence is inferred through its gravitational effects on galaxies and large-scale structures.</p>
      
      <h4>Evidence for Dark Matter</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Galaxy Rotation Curves:</strong> The outer regions of galaxies rotate at unexpected speeds, suggesting the presence of unseen mass.</li>
        <li><strong>Gravitational Lensing:</strong> Light from distant galaxies is bent more than expected, indicating additional mass.</li>
        <li><strong>Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):</strong> The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB suggests dark matter plays a role in the formation of cosmic structures.</li>
        <li><strong>Galaxy Cluster Mass Discrepancy:</strong> The total mass inferred from visible matter is much less than the actual gravitational influence detected.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4>Theories on Dark Matter</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs):</strong> Hypothetical particles that interact only through gravity and the weak nuclear force.</li>
        <li><strong>Axions:</strong> Extremely light particles that may account for dark matter.</li>
        <li><strong>Modified Gravity Theories:</strong> Some theories propose modifications to gravity rather than requiring dark matter.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Dark Energy: The Force Driving Cosmic Expansion</h3>
      <p>Dark energy is an unknown form of energy that permeates space and is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe.</p>
      
      <h4>Evidence for Dark Energy</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Supernova Observations:</strong> Distant Type Ia supernovae appear dimmer than expected, implying an accelerating universe.</li>
        <li><strong>Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):</strong> The large-scale geometry of the universe suggests a need for an additional energy component.</li>
        <li><strong>Large-Scale Structure Growth:</strong> The way galaxies and galaxy clusters evolve indicates the presence of repulsive energy.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4>Theories on Dark Energy</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cosmological Constant (Λ):</strong> Proposed by Einstein, this represents a constant energy density filling space.</li>
        <li><strong>Quintessence:</strong> A dynamic field that evolves over time, unlike the static cosmological constant.</li>
        <li><strong>Modified Gravity Theories:</strong> Some alternatives suggest that changes in gravity at large scales may explain cosmic acceleration without dark energy.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>The Interplay of Dark Matter and Dark Energy</h3>
      <p>Dark matter provides the gravitational pull that forms galaxies, while dark energy drives the universe’s accelerated expansion. Understanding their relationship is key to solving major cosmological puzzles.</p>
      
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Despite their invisible nature, dark matter and dark energy shape the universe in fundamental ways. Ongoing research, including experiments like the Large Hadron Collider and space telescopes like Euclid, aims to uncover their true nature. These mysteries continue to challenge our understanding of physics, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.</p>
