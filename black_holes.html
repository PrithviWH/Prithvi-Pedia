            <h2>Black Holes</h2>
            <p>Black holes are among the most fascinating and mysterious objects in the universe. They are regions of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. The concept of black holes originates from Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity and has been a major area of research in astrophysics.</p>
            
            <h3>Formation of Black Holes</h3>
            <p>Black holes form from the remnants of massive stars that undergo gravitational collapse. When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer support itself against gravity, leading to an implosion. If the collapsing core is massive enough, it becomes a singularity—a point of infinite density surrounded by an event horizon.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Black Holes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stellar Black Holes:</strong> Formed from collapsing stars, these have masses between a few to dozens of times the Sun’s mass.</li>
                <li><strong>Supermassive Black Holes:</strong> Found at the centers of galaxies, including the Milky Way, these black holes can be millions to billions of times more massive than the Sun.</li>
                <li><strong>Intermediate Black Holes:</strong> With masses between stellar and supermassive black holes, they are rare and often found in dense star clusters.</li>
                <li><strong>Primordial Black Holes:</strong> Hypothetical black holes that may have formed in the early universe due to high-density fluctuations.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Event Horizon: The Point of No Return</h3>
            <p>The event horizon is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape. Once an object crosses this limit, it is inevitably pulled toward the singularity.</p>
            
            <h3>Hawking Radiation and Black Hole Evaporation</h3>
            <p>Physicist Stephen Hawking proposed that black holes emit radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This phenomenon, known as Hawking radiation, suggests that black holes can slowly lose mass and eventually evaporate over astronomical timescales.</p>
            
            <h3>Observational Evidence</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gravitational Lensing:</strong> The bending of light around a black hole.</li>
                <li><strong>Accretion Disks:</strong> Hot, glowing matter spiraling into a black hole.</li>
                <li><strong>X-ray Emissions:</strong> Detected from matter heating up as it falls into a black hole.</li>
                <li><strong>Gravitational Waves:</strong> Ripples in spacetime caused by black hole mergers.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The First Image of a Black Hole</h3>
            <p>In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) captured the first-ever image of a black hole in the galaxy M87. This historic achievement provided direct visual evidence of black holes and confirmed predictions made by Einstein’s theory.</p>
            
            <h3>Black Holes and Time Dilation</h3>
            <p>Due to their immense gravity, black holes significantly warp spacetime. According to Einstein’s theory, time slows down near a black hole, a phenomenon known as gravitational time dilation.</p>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Black holes are extreme objects that challenge our understanding of physics. They play a crucial role in galaxy formation, the fate of stars, and even the fundamental laws of the universe.</p>
